React-soft-slider is a minimally-featured carousel. It focuses on providing the best user experience for manipulating slides. It doesn't try to implement additional features such as pagination dots, next and previous buttons, autoplay. If you're looking for a slider that has all this, there's [plenty](https://github.com/akiran/react-slick) of [alternatives](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/nuka-carousel) [out](https://github.com/express-labs/pure-react-carousel) [there](https://github.com/voronianski/react-swipe).

This allows react-soft-slider to be highly impartial when it comes to styling, so you shouldn't be fighting too hard to making the slider slider look the way you want.

- **Touch-gesture compatible:** handles swipe and drag on mobile and desktop devices
- **Spring animations:** driven by high-performance springs
- **Impartial styling:** you are responsible for the styling of your slides
- **Fully responsive:** as long as your slides styling is responsive as well!
- **Dynamic number of slides:** you can add or remove slides on the fly

React-soft-slider is powered by [react-spring](https://github.com/react-spring/react-spring) for springs animation and [react-use-gesture](https://github.com/react-spring/react-use-gesture) for handling the drag gesture.

## Installation

```
npm install react-soft-slider
```

> ⚠️ You also want to add the [intersection-observer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/intersection-observer) and [resize-observer](resize-observer-polyfill) polyfills for full browser support. Check out adding the [polyfills](#polyfills) for details about how you can include it.

## Usage

`<Slider />` has a very limited logic, and essentially does two things:

1. it positions the slider to the slide matching the `index` you passed as a prop
2. when the user changes the slide, it will then fire `onIndexChange` that will pass you the new `index`. You will usually respond by updating the slider `index` prop:

```jsx
import { Slider } from 'react-soft-slider'

const slides = ['red', 'blue', 'yellow', 'orange']
const style = { width: 300, height: '100%', margin: '0 10px' }

function App() {
  const [index, setIndex] = React.useState(0)

  return (
    <Slider
      index={index}
      onIndexChange={setIndex}
      style={{ width: 400, height: 200 }}
    >
      {slides.map((color, i) => (
        <div key={i} style={{ ...style, background: color }} />
      ))}
    </Slider>
  )
}
```

As you can see from the example, any child of the `<Slider />` component is considered as a slide. You are fully responsible for the appearance of the slides, and each slide can be styled independently.

> **Note:** although the above example uses hooks, react-soft-slider is compatible with Class-based components. However, since it internally uses hooks, it requires React `16.8+`.

### Props

The `<Slider />` component accepts the following props:

| Name              | Type                                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Default Value                     |

| `children`        | `node`                              | elements you should pass to the slider and that will be considered as slides                                                                                                                                                               | Required                          |
| `index`           | `number`                            | the index of the slide that should be shown by the slider                                                                                                                                                                                  | Required                          |
| `onIndexChange()` | `(newIndex: number) => void`        | function called by the slider when the slide index should change                                                                                                                                                                           | Required                          |
| `indexRange`      | `[number,number]`                   | sets the minimum and maximum index range the slider should slide through. If the maximum index is negative, then it's set relatively to the children length. [See example here](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-soft-slider-example-o7k0g). |                                   |

### Springs configuration

React-soft-slider uses two springs, one for the dragged slide, and one for the other slides, that you can configure to your liking. It accepts any options supported by react-spring, including durations if you're not happy with how springs feel [see here for more info](https://www.react-spring.io/docs/hooks/api).

## Gotchas

**Sizing the slider**

The slider wrapper has a default width set to `100%`, so that it fills its container by default. You can override this behaviour by passing your own `style` or `className` props.

**Sizing your slides relatively to the slider**

If you want to size your slides relatively to the slider width (let's say `width: 80%`), you'll need to rely on `slideStyle` set to `{{ minWidth: '80%' }}` and styling your slide with `width` set to `100%`. The same logic applies for height when in vertical sliding mode.

**Don't use transform styling in slideStyle**

React-soft-slider uses the `transform` attribute to make slides move so transform attributes in `slideStyle` will get overriden.

**React-soft-slider is open to suggestions!**

React-soft-slider will probably never include slider peripheral features, but is open to suggestions to make handling your slides easier!

### Polyfills

You can import the
[IntersectionObserver polyfill](https://www.npmjs.com/package/intersection-observer) and [ResizeObserver polyfill](https://www.npmjs.com/package/resize-observer-polyfill) directly or use
a service like [polyfill.io](https://polyfill.io/v2/docs/) to add it when
needed.

```sh
yarn add intersection-observer resize-observer-polyfill
```

Then import it in your app:

```js
import 'intersection-observer'
import 'resize-observer-polyfill'
```

If you are using Webpack (or similar) you could use
[dynamic imports](https://webpack.js.org/api/module-methods/#import-), to load
the Polyfill only if needed. A basic implementation could look something like
this:

```js
/**
 * Do feature detection, to figure out which polyfills needs to be imported.
 **/
async function loadPolyfills() {
  if (typeof window.IntersectionObserver === 'undefined') {
    await import('intersection-observer')
  }
  if (typeof window.ResizeObserver === 'undefined') {
    await import('resize-observer-polyfill')
  }
}
```
